* Patterns
** What is a Pattern
The GoF had 4 elements for specifying a design pattern.
Today you have 6:
- Context :: What is your task, give a little background information
- Intent :: What do you want to solve?
- Forces :: What does it make hard to solve this problem?
- Benefits :: What is positive when implemented?
- Liabilities :: What does it cost you?


Example:
- Context: Design a waiting room 
- Intent: efficient use of time
- Forces: different needs of different people
- Benefits: well-being $\uparrow$
- Liabilities: Costs
** Pattern Language
A Pattern Languages combine patterns according to their relationships.
If you have established a Pattern Language, you can read a text and just insert the name of the patterns, and it does make sense.
* GoF
** Mediator
The Mediator Design Pattern is used to encapsulate how a set of objects interact with each other.
The different objects do not have to reference each other explicit.

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/mediator.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Mediator Class Diagram}\label{fig:mediator-class-diagram}
#+LATEX: }

*** How does it work?
The mediator holds a reference to every object.
The user selected some item from the list box (object A).
Object A notifies the mediator that the value has changed.
The mediator know notifies the other objects.

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/mediator_sequence_diagram.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Mediator Sequence Diagram}\label{fig:mediator-sequence-diagram}
#+LATEX: }

** Memento
The Memento Design Pattern is used to store an internal state.
This is often used for restoring the internal state of an object.

The object creates a memento (a copy of the state itself) and returns it to the world.
The state of the object can be restored using such a memento.
You can not change the memento and the inner live is unknown to the outer world.


#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/memento.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Memento Class Diagram}\label{fig:memento-class-diagram}
#+LATEX: }
** Command
The command pattern is used to encapsulate actions / request inside an object.
For example, the design of a framework does not know which action the button should perform.
Therefore, the button is created using a command as parameter.
As soon as the user clicks on the button, the button executions the =command.Execute()= function.

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/command.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Command Class Diagram}\label{fig:command-class-diagram}
#+LATEX: }

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/example_of_command.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Example of Command Pattern}\label{fig:example-of-command-pattern}
#+LATEX: }
** Command Processor
The Command Processor is an extension of the Command Pattern.
The Command Processor is more or less just a [[id:9b107c73-f9af-4c32-a9ea-de91614d6d1a][Stack]] of Commands.

The Command Processor gets the command (=do_it=).
If you want to undo more than one command you just call =undo_it= multiple times on the processor.


#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/command_processor.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Command Processor}\label{fig:command-processor}
#+LATEX: }
** Visitor
The Visitor Patter is used to "visit" class hierarchy.
The visitor can perform action on the visited elements (for example spell checking in a document).

It is easy to implement a new Visitor (Just implement the Interface).
However, extending the class hierarchy with a new subclass is very difficult.
You have to extend the interface =Visitor= and therefore all implementations of this interface.

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/visitor.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Visitor Class Diagram}\label{fig:visitor-class-diagram}
#+LATEX: }

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/visitor_sequence.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Visitor Sequence}\label{fig:visitor-sequence}
#+LATEX: }

** (External) Iterator
The iterator design pattern is used to access the items in a [[id:9cf8949b-7cd7-4ba9-a379-bfaaf915475f][Data structure]] (Aggregate in figure ref:fig:iterator-class-diagram).
The benefit of iterator is that it hides the implementation details of the data structure.

#+begin_src rust
  let my_vec = vec![1, 10];
  let iter = my_vec.iter();
  let _ = iter.next();
  let _ = iter.next();
  // ...
#+end_src


#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/iterator.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Iterator Class Diagram}\label{fig:iterator-class-diagram}
#+LATEX: }
** Internal Iterator
The internal Iterator is used to iterate over a data structure.
In contrast to the [[id:4ce9446c-0cb7-4ed8-9a25-4cf9f18e0838][Design Pattern - External Iterator]] you provide a function, which is called for each element.

#+CAPTION: Internal Iterator Examples
#+NAME: lst:internal-iterator-examples
#+begin_src csharp
  List<T>.ForEach(Action<T>); // C#
  Collection.forEach(); // Java
  Stream.forEach(); // Java
  Array.prototype.forEach(); // JS
#+end_src
** State
The state pattern is used allow an object to alter its internal behavior depending on its state.
The object will appear to change its class.

#+LATEXI: {
[[file:img/state.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{State Class Diagram}\label{fig:state-class-diagram}
#+LATEXI: }

#+LATEXI: {
[[file:img/state_example.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{TCP Connection with State}\label{fig:tcp-connection-with-state}
#+LATEXI: }
 
** Method for States
The Methods for States Pattern is a derivation of the State Pattern by GoF.
A State is represented as a collection of functions (struct, HashMap, enum, ...).
The State Machine itself stores such a collection of function inside and just executes the function on the struct.


#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/methods_for_states.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Methods For State Example}\label{NAME: Methods For State Example}
#+LATEX: }
** Collection for States
Collection for States is a way to handle multiple objects in a particular state.
For each state you have a list / collection, which contains the objects in this state.

If an event is triggered, then the event is executed on all objects in the list, which should handle this.
The distinction between the states is made depending on which list / collection the work item is.
** Factory Method
The Factory Method is used to create an object, but the subclass decides which class is instantiated.
With this pattern you can create concrete creators which can decide which concrete product should be created.
The user of the creator only has to use the interface.


#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/factory_method.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Factory Method Class Diagram}\label{fig:factory-method-class-diagram}
#+LATEX: }
** Template Method
Using the Template Method Pattern you write the skeleton for an algorithm in the base class.
The functions which do something with data can be overwritten in a subclass.

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/template_method.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Template Method Class Diagram}\label{fig:template-method-class-diagram}
#+LATEX: }
*** Example
In an algorithm to traverse a tree in order you can implement a function =handleData()=.
This function is called every time when the element is "in order".
You have now one implementation of the algorithm, but you can handle the data differently using subclasses.

** Strategy
The Strategy Pattern is used to encapsulate an algorithm in an object.
With this approach you can change the algorithm at runtime.

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/strategy_pattern.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Strategy Class Diagram}\label{fig:strategy-class-diagram}
#+LATEX: }
** Flyweight
The Flyweight pattern is used to support large number of objects efficiently.
For example, you can store every character in its own object.
In a document with 1000 characters you need more than 1000 objects.
The Flyweight pattern helps here.

In the Flyweight class is only state indecent stuff stored.
Therefore, the Flyweight is shareable.
Instead, creating every time a new object with the character "a" you always reference to the same object.


#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/flyweight_example.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Flyweight Example}\label{fig:flyweight-example}
#+LATEX: }

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/flyweight.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Flyweight Class Diagram}\label{fig:flyweight-class-diagram}
#+LATEX: }
* Value Patterns
** Value Object
The Value Object Pattern is used to represent a class as values (immutable).
In [[id:d4e5f169-81a7-4ce9-a0ff-e85399b1294a][Java]] you don't have a Value Type =Year=.
Year however, is just a number.
With the Value Object Pattern you can simulate the same behavior for the Class =Year= as it was a type =int=.
The Identity is *not* important for such a type / value.


In [[id:8fc49f58-a615-4348-ae3a-693f6b69655b][C#]] just use the =struct= keyword.
In [[id:d4e5f169-81a7-4ce9-a0ff-e85399b1294a][Java]] use the =record= keyword.
However, you have to do some more stuff in Java.

#+begin_quote
«Override the methods in Object whose action should be related to content and not
identity and implement serializable.» [Henney]
#+end_quote

#+begin_src java
  public final class Date implements Serializable {
      // …
      private static final long serialVersionUID = -3248069808529497555L;
      // …
      @Override
      public boolean equals(Object o) {
	  if (this == o) return true;
	  if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
	  Date date = (Date) o;
	  return year.equals(date.year) && month.equals(date.month) && day.equals(date.day);
      }
      @Override
      public int hashCode() {
	  return Objects.hash(year, month, day);
      }
  }
#+end_src
** Whole Value
The Whole Value Pattern answers the following question:
#+begin_quote
How can you represent primitive quantities from your problem domain without loss
of meaning?

«Express the type of the quantity as a Value Class.» [Henney]
#+end_quote

The Whole Value can be immutable, but it is not required to be.

#+begin_src java
  public final class Year {
      public Year(int year) { value = year; }
      public int getValue() { return value; }
      private final int value;
  }

  public final class Date {
      public Date(Year year, Month month, Day day) { /**/ }
      /**/
  }
  Date first = new Date(new Year(year), new Month(month), new Day(day));
#+end_src
** Enumeration Value
An enumeration value is just an Enum in [[id:d4e5f169-81a7-4ce9-a0ff-e85399b1294a][Java]], [[id:8fc49f58-a615-4348-ae3a-693f6b69655b][C#]] or [[id:578e2997-4791-4315-b980-33ad95df881c][Rust]].
** Immutable Value
An Immutable Value can not be changed.
That means all internal fields are =const= or =final=.

#+CAPTION: Example for Immutable Value
#+NAME: lst:example-for-immutable-value
#+begin_src csharp
  struct Value {
      readonly int _value;
  }
#+end_src
** Simple Factory
Intent:
- Provide an interface for creating objects without specifying the concrete implementation.

Motivation:
- You want to create concrete objects without knowing which concrete type you get.
- You are only interested in the interface.
** Mutable Companion
#+begin_quote
How can you simplify complex construction of an Immutable Value?
#+end_quote


A Mutable Companion is a factory object for immutable values.
=StringBuilder= is an example for such a Mutable Companion for =Strings=.
For the final creation of the object (see [[autoref:lst:example-for-mutable-companion]]) you use the [[id:2d54848d-995e-423c-b60b-4867b0731b68][Design Pattern - Factory Method]].

#+CAPTION: Example for Mutable Companion
#+NAME: lst:example-for-mutable-companion
#+begin_src java
  var yearBuilder = new YearCompanion(Year.of(2020));
  yearBuilder.next();
  var nextYear = yearBuilder.asValue();

  public final class YearCompanion {
      private int value;

      public YearCompanion(Year toModify) {
	  this.value = toModify.getValue();
      }
      public void next() {
	  this.value++;
      }
      public Year asValue() { // factory method
	  return Year.of(value);
      }
  }
#+end_src
* CHECKS Patterns
** Exceptional Behavior
#+begin_quote
How can exceptional behavior caused by invalid input be handled without throwing errors?
#+end_quote

If your function should indicate an error, but should not throw an error / exception then return an /exceptional value/ in an error case.
An /exceptional value/ could be:
- =null= or =undefined= (not recommended)
- Enumeration Value to identify what went wrong


#+CAPTION: Example for Exceptional Behavior
#+NAME: lst:example-for-exceptional-behavior
#+begin_src js
  export enum CalculationError {
      DivByZero = "div/0",
      NumeratorIsNaN = "NaN(numerator)",
      DivisorIsNaN = "NaN(divisor)"
  }

  export class Calculator {
      public static divide(numerator: number, divisor: number): number | CalculationError {
	  if (divisor === 0) {return CalculationError.DivByZero; }
	  if (isNaN(numerator)) {return CalculationError.NumertorIsNaN; }
	  if (isNaN(divisor)) {return CalculationError.DivisorIsNaN; }

	  return numerator / divisor;
      }
  }
#+end_src
** Meaningless Behavior
#+begin_quote
Write methods (without) with minimalistic concern for possible failure.
#+end_quote

You will return a meaningless value unless a condition has domain meaning
* Framework
** Framework
A framework is a collection of classes, functions, ... that are working together.
A framework provides /hook/ for /extensions/.
In contrast to a library is, that the framework own the control flow and calls *your* components ([[id:ada99318-f3b5-4987-9154-e5c3893fc1f5][Inversion of Control]]).


Examples:
- Java
  - Hibernate
  - Velocity
- C#
  - .NET / Core
  - Entity Framework
- JS
  - Vue.js
** Application Framework
An Application Framework is a special kind of framework.
In a framework you use the framework, and you start the framework.
In an Application Framework the "main" method lives inside the application framework.

An example for an Application Framework is Eclipse.
Based on the Eclipse you can create many other products (Java IDE, C++ IDE, ...).

Examples:
- Java
  - Spring (Boot)
  - Application Server (J2EE)
- C#
  - ASP.NT
- JS
  - Angular
* Reflection
** Reflection
Reflection consists of two aspects:
- /Introspection/ (observe own state, e.g. query object properties)
- /Intercession/ (modify own state, e.g. add another attribute)

#+begin_quote
In computer science, reflective programming or reflection is the ability of a process to examine, introspect, and modify its own structure and behavior. [Wikipedia]
#+end_quote


#+begin_src java
  if (origin instanceof Cloneable) {
      cloned = ((Cloneable)origin).clone();
  } else {
      cloned = origin.getClass().getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
      // ...
      BeanUtils.copyProperties(origin, cloned); // get data from getters, fill into setters.
  }
#+end_src
** Meta Level Programming
The /Meta Level/ provides a self-representaiton
- gives the software knowledge of its own structure
- consists of [[id:dc5ac5a1-9ee0-4b80-a8fe-a7bfad288061][Meta Objects]]
- interface for manipulation meta objects is called [[id:ef8933a6-d09b-4e73-8584-eeee0f20489b][Metaobject Protocol]]


The /base level/ defines the application logic.

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/meta_base_level.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Meta Level and Base Level}\label{fig:meta-level-and-base-level}
#+LATEX: }
** Meta Object
If a programming language uses reflections it uses meta objects for:
- classes
- object attributes
- methods
- class relationships
- ...


#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/meta_object_relationships.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Meta Object class relations}\label{fig:meta-object-class-relations}
#+LATEX: }
** Meta Object Protocol
The Metaobject protocol provides a vocabulary to access and manipulate the structure and behavior of a system of objects.
** Pro / Con Reflection
Benefits:
- Adapting a software system is easy
- support for many kinds of changes


Liabilities:
- Produces non-transparent APIs
  - control flow already hard to understand with polymorphism
- binding at runtime (late binding)
  - limited type safety (Rename class, but class name in string during reflection class is not renamed)
  - lower efficiency, no compiler-optimizaiton
** Type Object
A Rental System contains books and videos.
For each book / video multiple copies may exist.
The descriptive information (title, author, actors) is stored in the book / video class (shared among copies).
Each media item type has own data and behavior.

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/rental_system_example.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Rental System Example}\label{fig:rental-system-example}
#+LATEX: }
*Problem*:
- We want to keep common behavior and data in only one place
  - object behavior depends on category (video / book)
  - categories should be objects themselves

#+begin_quote
How can you categorize objects, eventually dynamically?

Categorize objects by another object instead of a class (Book, Video)
Thus, an object can change 'class' at runtime.
#+end_quote


*Solution*:
- crate a category (/type/) object which describes multiple objects
- /objects/ forward the calls to the underlying type


#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/type_object_meta_base_level.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Meta / Base Level Interactions}\label{fig:meta-base-level-interactions}
#+LATEX: }

#+CAPTION: Example for Type Object
#+NAME: lst:example-for-type-object
#+begin_src java
  // Base level
  public class Copy {
      protected MediaType type;
      protected int copyid; // invoentory no

      public int getId() { return copyid; }
      // example for delegation
      public String getTypeid() { return type.getId(); }
      public String getTitle() { return type.getTitle() ;}
  }

  // Meta level
  public class MediaType {
      protected String title;
      protected String typeid;

      public String getId() { return typeid; }
      public String getTitle() { return title; }
  }
#+end_src
** Property List
*Problem*:
- attributes should be attachable / detachable after compilation
- objects share attributes / parameters across the class hierarchy


#+begin_quote
How do you define properties (also arguments) in a flexible way, so they can be attached and detached at runtime?

Provide objects with a 'property list'. That list allows to associate names with other values or objects.
#+end_quote


*Solution*:
- property list maps attribute names to values
- each name (e.g. a string) defines a slot / property

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/property_list_example.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Property List Example}\label{fig:property-list-example}
#+LATEX: }

#+CAPTION: Example for Anything
#+NAME: lst:example-for-anything
#+begin_src java
  public class Graphics {
      private Properties pl;

      public String get(String prop) {
	  return pl.getProperty(prop, "");
      }
      public void set(String prop, Object value) {
	  pl.setProperty(prop, value);
      }
  }

  package java.util;
  public class Properties {
      public Set<String> stringPropertyNames() { /**/ }
      public String getProperty(String prop, String defaultValue) { /**/ }
      public String setProperty(String prop, Object value) { /**/ }
  }
#+end_src


*Benefits*:
- you can extend the object with properties at runtime while keeping object identity


*Liabilities*:
- Type safety left to the programmer (see [[id:ae58dcf1-4aa6-41d6-8c1f-10df7178babc][Design Pattern - Bridge Method]])
- naming not checked by a compiler (see [[id:ae58dcf1-4aa6-41d6-8c1f-10df7178babc][Design Pattern - Bridge Method]])
** Anything
The Anything Pattern can be used to describe / create arbitrary data structure.
The Anything Pattern is something like a recursively structured Property List ([[id:ae598d12-1d58-40bf-ad70-5dd6b7814cda][Design Pattern - Property List]])

An object is a collection of properties (property list) where you access the different values by name / key.
An array is a collection of properties (property list) where you access the different values by index.


#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/anything_pattern.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Anything Class Diagram}\label{fig:anything-class-diagram}
#+LATEX: }
* Singleton
** Singleton
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one (global) instance.
Additionally, it provides easy access to this element.

However, you should *NOT* use it in your software.
It is basically a global variable.
Therefore, not testable and difficult to maintain.

If you want something like singleton, you should use a simple factory which always returns the same instance.


#+CAPTION: Singelton alternative in code
#+NAME: lst:singelton-alternative-in-code
#+begin_src csharp
  class SingletonFactory {
      private static object myInstance;

      createObject() {
	  if (SingletonFactory.myInstance == null) {
	      SingletonFactory.myInstance = new();
	  }
	  return SingletonFactory.myInstance;
      }
  }
#+end_src

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/singleton.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Singelton Class Diagram}\label{fig:singelton-class-diagram}
#+LATEX: }
** Registry
The Singleton Design Pattern is evil and should not be used.
An alternative could be the Registry pattern.

You will register multiple singletons in the registry.
Using a =lookup(name)= function you will get your specific singleton.
The =instance()= returns the default singleton from the registry.


#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/registry.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Registry UML}\label{fig:registry uml}
#+LATEX: }
** Monostate
If you have to use a framework, which provides a singleton you can kill this singleton using a /Monostate/.
A monostate is a normal class, *but* all member variables are static members (see [[autoref:lst:example-for-a-simple-monostate]] and [[autoref:lst:kill-a-singleton]]).
*Attention:* In parallel and async execution you have to sync the access to static members.


#+CAPTION: Example for a simple monostate
#+NAME: lst:example-for-a-simple-monostate
#+begin_src java
  public class Monostate {
      private static int x;
      private static int y;

      public int getX() { return x; }
      public int getY() { return y; }
  }
#+end_src


#+CAPTION: Kill a singleton
#+NAME: lst:kill-a-singleton
#+begin_src java
  public interface Monostate {
      int getX();
      int getY();
  }

  public class MonostateImpl implements Monostate {
      public int getX() {
	  return Singleton.getInstance().getX();
      }

      public int getY() {
	  return Singleton.getInstance().getY();
      }
  }
#+end_src
** Service Locator
The Service Locator is a singleton, which only returns services or finders to find the concrete service.
The Service Locator is similar to a Registry.
If you use the Service Locator you have only *one* singleton in your application.

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/service_locator.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Service Locator UML}\label{fig:service-locator-uml}
#+LATEX: }

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/service_locator_dynamics.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Service Locator Dynamics}\label{fig:service-locator-dynamics}
#+LATEX: }

** Parameterize from Above
Often you have functionality which should be shared over multiple or all layers (configuration, security).
To solve this problem, without creating a singleton you can use /Parameterize from Above/.
In the main method you will create all services.
And you provide all services over the constructor (form above, see [[autoref:lst:example-for-parameteriz-from-above]]).

#+LATEX: {
[[file:img/vertical_and_horizontal_layering.png]]
#+LATEX: \captionof{figure}{Horizontal and vertical layering}\label{fig:horizontal-and-vertical-layering}
#+LATEX: }

#+CAPTION: Example for Parameteriz from Above
#+NAME: lst:example-for-parameteriz-from-above
#+begin_src java
  public final class Bootstrapper {
      public static void main(string[] args) { // PfA applied
	  // instantiate vertical layer contexts first
	  SecurityContext securityContext = new SecurityContextImpl();
	  ConfigurationSettings configuration = new ConfigurationSettingsImpl(args);
	  // encapsulate variables into an application context
	  var applicationContext = new ApplicationContextImpl(
							      securityContext,
							      configuration);
	  // instantiate horizontal layer contexts from bottom to top
	  DataContext dlContext = new DataContextImpl(applicationContext);
	  BusinessContext blContext = new BusinessContextImpl(applicationContext, dlContext);
	  UIContext uiContext = new UIContextImpl(applicationContext, blContext);
	  // show initial UI dialog
	  uiContext.show();
      }
  }
#+end_src
** Dependency Injection
A Dependency Injection Container is used to store all services in a registry and injects the required services in the constructor while creating ([[id:e60596de-b6bc-478b-8c2d-69fc306eb7be][Parameterize from Above]]).

You register all services and components in the container.
The container will inject a compatible component according to your function signature.
